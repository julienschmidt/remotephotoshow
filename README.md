# remotephotoshow
A small server application to present photos remotely over the web

The complete family is gathered for christmas. The complete family?
No, Julien is more than 10000 km away.
This is a small hack I made the show my family some photos remotely over the web using [Server-Sent Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/) in Go (using [the sse package](https://github.com/julienschmidt/sse)).

## Usage
Modify the the [config](https://github.com/julienschmidt/remotephotoshow/blob/master/server.go#L25), put your photos in the configured directory and you are ready to run the app with `go run server.go`!

Protip: You can use your arrow keys in the master mode!
